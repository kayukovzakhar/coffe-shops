# coffe-shops
In this project I analysed sales of 3 coffee shops over the course of 2023.
By analyzing this dataset, I aim to understand customers preferences and key factors like time and place, which impact total sales. I compared metrics and sales trends across the shops to identify factors impacting customer behavior at each location, allowing to improve marketing strategies.

# Conclusion
I want to day, that in this project I applied some analysis strategies, which helped me to understand what Data Analysis is all about. In addition, it was my first time working with Seaborn library and I think it's great! Not complicated, easy to understand and very variative, I love it! 
Overall, the coffee points analytics surely helped me practice my skills, use my experience and knowledge, try and learn something new!
