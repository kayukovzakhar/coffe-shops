# coffe-shops
In this project I analysed sales of 3 coffee shops over the course of 2023.
By analyzing this dataset, I aim to understand customers preferences and key factors like time and place, which impact total sales. I compared metrics and sales trends across the shops to identify factors impacting customer behavior at each location, allowing to improve marketing strategies.

# Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib


# Conclusion
It was my first time working with Pandas and Matplotlib, and also it was my first time doing some data analysis. 

In process I learned a lot of different things, starting with how to combine sheets in Excel table and convert it to .csv, following with how to correctly clean data, work with Pandas dataframes (filter them, create new, do something with columns, rows and values) and ending with how to visualise data using Matplotlib.

Overall, it was a great expirience for me! Hope you well enjoyed and until next time!
